# MLP

This repository provides Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to build and train multilayer perceptron models using the Keras library. The notebooks cover three different datasets: Iris, Wine, and Boston Housing.

Each notebook follows a similar structure, starting with loading and preprocessing the data, defining the MLP architecture, training the model, and evaluating its performance on a test set. The notebooks include visualizations of the training and validation accuracy and loss, as well as sample predictions made by the model on test data.

In the Iris notebook, the MLP is trained to predict the species of iris flowers based on their measurements. The notebook includes visualizations of the data, as well as a detailed explanation of the MLP architecture and hyperparameters used.

In the Wine notebook, the MLP is trained to predict the origin of different wines based on their measurements. The notebook includes visualizations of the data, as well as a detailed explanation of the MLP architecture and hyperparameters used.

In the Boston Housing notebook, the MLP is trained to predict the median price of owner-occupied homes in different areas of Boston. The notebook includes visualizations of the data, as well as a detailed explanation of the MLP architecture and hyperparameters used.

Overall, the MLP section of my repository provides a useful resource for anyone looking to learn how to build and train MLP models using Keras. The notebooks are well-organized and easy to understand, and the included visualizations help to illustrate the concepts presented.
